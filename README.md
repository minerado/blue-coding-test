# Scenario

You are a web developer at the Acme Software Company. You are asked to build a polished prototype of a GIF browsing app. Since the back-end has not yet been created, you are asked to get started by using a publicly available API. An API Key will be provided to you by the person in charge of doing the evaluation.

# Task

Your task is to create a front-end web application that leverages data from the Giphy API (https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI).

Follow the instructions in the Debug tab to start your web server. Once you do, a placeholder for the app will be reachable at http://localhost:8000/ .

# Requirements

Your project will be manually reviewed and scored by an engineer according to the following requirements:

The page should never reload.

Provide a form for the user to perform a keyword search against the GIF database via the API.

Display the results as still thumbnails on the page in a layout that makes sense. A large volume of results should load in a performance-minded fashion.

Clicking on a thumbnail should launch a lightbox-style modal view that allows the user to browse through individual GIFs as a slideshow. The GIFs in this view should be fully animated.

Add a new page with the history of the searches of the user, with the possibility of cleaning it up.

Create a polished visual design and user experience.

Code in a clean, readable way following all normal conventions.

The goal is for you to create your own lightbox and slideshow app - do not use a prebuilt solution.

Develop and test your work using a desktop Chrome/Chromium browser. Your work will be manually reviewed using desktop Chrome/Chromium, exclusively.

If you have any notes or instructions about the exercise, please write them in the file README.md.
